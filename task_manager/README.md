# Task Manager (Python CLI Project)

This is a command-line task manager application that allows users to:

- Add tasks with a description, due date, and priority (High, Medium, Low)
- View all tasks sorted by due date
- Filter tasks by priority level
- Remove tasks by selecting their ID
- Exit the program

The program validates user inputs, including date format and priority values, and uses task IDs to avoid ambiguity when removing tasks.
