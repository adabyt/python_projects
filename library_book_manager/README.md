# Library Manager (Python CLI Project)

This is a command-line application for managing a small library of books. It allows users to:

- Add new books with title, author, and due date
- Search for books by title or author
- List all books, showing which are overdue
- Remove books from the collection

The program uses Python’s built-in `datetime` module to compare due dates with the current date, and handles invalid date inputs gracefully.

## Features

- Add books with due dates
- Automatically flag books as overdue or not
- Search by title or author (case-insensitive)
- List all books in the collection
- Remove books by title or author
- Input validation for menu selection and date formats
- Modular design with reusable display formatting
