# Substitution Cipher (Python CLI Encryption Tool)

A basic encryption/decryption tool using a randomly shuffled substitution cipher. Users can encrypt messages by mapping each character to a shuffled key and decrypt them using the same key.

---

## Features

- Randomized substitution cipher key
- Supports letters, digits, punctuation, and whitespace
- Encrypts and decrypts messages using a consistent character map
- Key is printed after encryption (must be saved for decryption)
- Clean CLI interface with mode selection

## Example Interaction

```plaintext
Welcome to the Simple Substitution Cipher

1. Encrypt a message
2. Decrypt a message
Choose an option (1 or 2): 1
Enter a message to encrypt: hello world!

Encrypted message: OUXxK7w)XK#o
Key used: &|VPGz... (store this key safely!)
```
